# gv
## Google Voice command line client

*gv* is a command line client for Google Voice. It intends to replicate most of the same functionality that can be done through google.com/voice, and provide an easily scriptable interface.

gv uses git-style subcommands and includes `` `gv-send` ``, `` `gv-ls` ``, and `` `gv-contacts` ``.
